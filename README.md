## 2021 MDDN342 Assignment 1: Randomised Collections

Parameters:
S1 - Face Shape / Discreet, Can be Circular or square. This is 50% for either
S2 - Face Type / Discreet, Hairy vs Control. This is 50% for either.
S3 - Wave Amplitude / Continuous, goes between 0 and 1. 0 results in straight hairs.
S4 - Wave Length / Discreet, only works on the circular face and controls how many vertices make up the hair, goes in integers from 1 to 10.
S5 - Eye type / Discreet, Can be circular or elliptical, 50/50 for either, round eyes track the mouse cursor, elliptical eyes look away from the camera.
S6 - Height / Continuous, goes from 0 to 5, also changes the opacity of the shadow.
S7 - Background Colour / Discreet, 10% for the blue background.

My face designs are inspired by Kazumasa Nagai's posters. https://www.pinterest.nz/pin/805018502145879214/ This one in particular. I really like the chaos of the hand-drawn lines, and the strange eye design.

Before there is any randomness the faces are seperated by 2 sets of parameters:

Hairy or not hairy

Circular or square

I wanted to have blank faces that act as 'control' faces, to make the 'hairy' faces stand out further.

My final sketch varies somewhat from my intial sketch, where I found that I didn't want to have as much variation in face designs, I like that all of the faces look somewhat the same but, are never the same due to the number of ways that the 'hair' that be drawn randomly.

I also used varying opacity for each of the strands of hair to emphasize the chaoticness of it.

When the potential range of different faces was larger, I felt like it made the individual faces feel less special.

I made the eyes track the cursor as I wanted to expand on the somewhat disturbing or unnatural appearance of the faces.

I added the drop shadow to give the faces some depth in the page, and to also give them better presence, as if they are actually standing there in formation, and aren't hanging in thin air.

I chose to use a small 3x2 grid for my arrangement, because I didnt want to make the faces any smaller than they currently are, but I also value the whitespace that is left around the characters as I think it adds to the final composiion, and proportion of colour across the page.

Using a rigid grid as opposed to a randomised position also creates nice contrast between the chaos of the hair of the faces.

I also drew all of the different face variances from the one drawface function, as in my arrangement I wanted any combination of face to appear anywhere on the grid.

I also chose to not include any random colours in project and stick to a set colour palette because I didn't want to have the potential for any colours that do not compliment each other.

Overall very happy with the final output, I'm not sure I would do anything differently if I were to do this again.
